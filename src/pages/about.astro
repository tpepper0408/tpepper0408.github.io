      <p>
        I'm Tim Pepper - I've worked in software development for over a decade, most recently as a practice lead for software engineering, and in a variety of tech leadership roles in various guises. Expect a (hopefully) insightful mix of tech-y nonsense.

        What I Do
      </h2>

      <p>
        As a tech leader, I focus on building inclusive, high-performing teams whilst
        delivering complex software projects that actually work. I also love creating environments where 
        people can do their best work.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical background is <strong>broad</strong>... starting with Java and mobile development within Healthcare, expanding into 
        JavaScript/TypeScript fullstack work in Retail and Health settings. I've worked primarily in Azure with stints in AWS and 
        Cloudflare. I've touched everything from .NET to Vue.js to Kotlin. Lately, I've been tinkering with AI to see what's actually useful versus what's just hype.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-display font-semibold border-l-4 border-accent-cyan pl-4 my-8">
        Beyond the Code
      </h2>

      <p>
        I'm a big EDI advocate with a focus on gender and LGBTQ+ inclusion, 
        having run a team of diversity and inclusion champions, I work to make tech more welcoming and 
        accessible. I'm a board member for Women in Digital Leeds, and I've been fortunate to 
        speak at events and win awards for this work. Community and inclusivity aren't just "nice to have" for me—they're central to how I lead 
        and what I value.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm also a big video game and music nerd with an MA in philosophy. Love some live comedy and you might find me behind the mic if you're lucky!
      </p>

        Why This Blog?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Pepper Headspace is my attempt to think out loud. I want a place to reflect on leadership 
        lessons, share what I'm learning (and unlearning), explore technical 
        rabbit holes, and occasionally talk about the weird projects and interests that don't fit 
        neatly into a LinkedIn profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing helps me process. If it helps you too, whether you're a fellow leader trying to 
        navigate consultancy, an engineer thinking about your next step, or someone just curious 
        about how this all works, then I'll call that a win.
      </p>

        Let's Connect
      </h2>

      <p>
        I'd love to hear from you. Whether you want to chat about tech leadership, share your own 
        experiences with diversity and inclusion in tech, or just say hi—reach out.
