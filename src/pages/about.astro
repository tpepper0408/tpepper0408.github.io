        I'm a Technical Lead and Director of Consulting Delivery, which is a fancy way of saying 
        I spend my days helping teams build better software and better ways of working together.
      </p>

      <p>
        My career started about 13 years ago as a backend Java engineer, a bridge into tech
        after a Masters in philosophy and gender studies. 
        Over time, I found myself drawn to the human side of technology: how 
        teams collaborate, how we create space for everyone to contribute, and how technical 
        decisions ripple through organizations. These days, I lead large consulting engagements 
        across healthcare and retail, bridging the gap between technical execution and meaningful impact.

        What I Do
      </h2>

      <p>
        As a technical leader, I focus on three things: building inclusive, high-performing teams; 
        delivering complex software projects that actually work; and creating environments where 
        people can do their best work. I've been a practice leader for software engineering, 
        mentored countless engineers and consultants, and spent years working on large-scale 
        engagements that touch real people's lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        My technical background is <strong>broad</strong> —starting with Java and mobile development, expanding into 
        JavaScript/TypeScript fullstack work, and working primarily in Azure with stints in AWS and 
        Cloudflare. I've touched everything from .NET to Vue.js to Kotlin. Lately, I've been 
        tinkering with Next.js, and dipping my toes into AI to see 
        what's actually useful versus what's just hype.
      </p>

        Beyond the Code
      </h2>

      <p>
        Some of the work I'm most proud of has nothing to do with shipping features. I used to run 
        a team of diversity and inclusion champions, working to make tech more welcoming and 
        accessible. I'm a board member for Women in Digital Leeds, and I've been fortunate to 
        speak at events and win awards for this work—not because I have all the answers, but 
        because I believe deeply that diverse teams build better things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Community and inclusivity aren't just "nice to have" for me—they're central to how I lead 
        and how I think about technology's role in the world.
      </p>

        Why This Blog?
      </h2>

      <p>
        Pepper Headspace is my attempt to think out loud. I want a place to reflect on leadership 
        lessons, share what I'm learning (and unlearning) about building teams, explore technical 
        rabbit holes, and occasionally talk about the weird projects and interests that don't fit 
        neatly into a LinkedIn profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Writing helps me process. If it helps you too—whether you're a fellow leader trying to 
        navigate consultancy, an engineer thinking about your next step, or someone just curious 
        about how this all works—then I'll call that a win.
      </p>

        I'd love to hear from you. Whether you want to chat about tech leadership, share your own 
        experiences with diversity and inclusion in tech, or just say hi—reach out.
